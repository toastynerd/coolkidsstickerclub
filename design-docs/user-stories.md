## Users who have not purchased yet (potential customer)

  * As a potential customer I want to find information on what the service is and how much it costs so I can determine if it would make a good gift for myself or someone else.
  * As a potential customer I want to examples of stickers that could be included with each shipment so I can see what I'm getting for my money.
  * As a potential customer I want an easy way to sign up and pay so I can get a last minute gift for someone.

## Users who have signed up (user)

  * As a user I want to have access to the service details(frequency of shipments, amount of stickers in shipment, etc) so I can remind myself why I joined CKSC.
  * As a user I want to know when a shipment is coming up so I can pick one of my stickers.
  * As a user I want to be able to see my payment status so I know when I can renew or cancel.
  * As a user I want to know when shipments have gone out and what tracking information is available so I can track them to my door.
  * As a user I want to receive an email(or some other notification) when the deadline to pick a sticker is coming up so I can pick them last minute if I forgot to do it earlier.

## Administrators

  * As an administrator I want to be able to see a list of customers and their payment status so I can know how many stickers I have to design/print.
  * As an administrator I want to be notified when a shipment event is coming up so I can budget time for it.
  * As an administrator I want to see what what stickers a user has chosen for the current shipment so I can ship those stickers.
  * As an administrator I want to know what stickers a user has received in the past so if it's dealer's choice the user doesn't get a repeat.
  * As an administrator I want to know what shipments have gone out so I don't ship them a second time.
